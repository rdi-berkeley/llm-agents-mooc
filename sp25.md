## Course Description

Large language model (LLM) agents have been an important frontier in AI, however, they still fall short critical skills, such as complex reasoning and planning, for solving hard problems and enabling end-to-end applications in real-world scenarios. Building on our [previous course](https://llmagents-learning.org/f24), this course dives deeper into advanced topics in LLM agents, focusing on reasoning, AI for mathematics, code generation, and program verification. We begin by introducing advanced inference and post-training techniques for building LLM agents that can search and plan. Then, we focus on two application domains: mathematics and programming. We study how LLMs can be used to prove mathematical theorems, as well as generate and reason about computer programs. Specifically, we will cover the following topics:
- Inference-time techniques for reasoning
- Post-training methods for reasoning
- Search and planning
- Agentic workflow, tool use, and functional calling
- LLMs for code generation and verification
- LLMs for mathematics: data curation, continual pretraining, and finetuning
- LLM agents for theorem proving and autoformalization

### Project

Check out our AgentX competition [website](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/agentx/). Every member of the team should sign up individually [here](https://forms.gle/iiszq2tBAFugfGqp8). There are no limits to team sizes.

Two Tracks:
- Entrepreneurship: Build agent-powered products & startups
- Research: Explore the frontiers of LLM Agents technology

Select students will be given mentorship by Berkeley postdocs/mentors on an AgentX Research Track project. Apply [here](https://forms.gle/E2D69euNBjSmYsK28). DUE March 26th at 11:59pm PDT. _NOTE: Mentorship is not required to join or succeed in AgentX._

Submissions will be due at the end of May. Please ask any questions and find potential team members in our [LLM Agents Discord](https://discord.gg/NWVpQ9rBvd).
