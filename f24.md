## Course Description

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains. In particular, LLMs have been developed as agents to interact with the world and handle various tasks. With the continuous advancement of LLM techniques, LLM agents are set to be the upcoming breakthrough in AI, and they are going to transform the future of our daily life with the support of intelligent task automation and personalization. In this course, we will first discuss fundamental concepts that are essential for LLM agents, including the foundation of LLMs, essential LLM abilities required for task automation, as well as infrastructures for agent development. We will also cover representative agent applications, including code generation, robotics, web automation, medical applications, and scientific discovery. Meanwhile, we will discuss limitations and potential risks of current LLM agents, and share insights into directions for further improvement. Specifically, this course will include the following topics:
- Foundation of LLMs
- Reasoning
- Planning, tool use
- LLM agent infrastructure
- Retrieval-augmented generation
- Code generation, data science
- Multimodal agents, robotics
- Evaluation and benchmarking on agent applications
- Privacy, safety and ethics
- Human-agent interaction, personalization, alignment
- Multi-agent collaboration

### Quizzes

All quizzes are released in parallel with (or shortly after) the corresponding lecture. Please remember to complete the quiz each week. Although itâ€™s graded on completion, we encourage you to do your best. The questions are all multiple-choice and there are usually at most 5 per quiz. The quizzes will be posted in the Syllabus section.

An archive of all of the quizzes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pYvOxt2UWwc3z4QlW2Di5LQT-FJPWZ419mxJT7pFPsU/edit?usp=sharing).

### Written Article

Create a twitter post, linkedin post, or medium article to post on Twitter of roughly 500 words. Include the link to our MOOC website in the article and tweet.

- Students in the Trailblazer or Mastery Tier should either summarize information from one of the lecture(s) or write a postmortem on their learning experience during our MOOC
- Students in the Ninja or Lengendary Tier should write about their hackathon submission

The written article is an effort-based assignment that will be graded as pass or no pass (P/NP). Submit your written article assignment [HERE](https://forms.gle/7ekobPNSWDLBWnDT6).

### Labs

There will be 3 lab assignments to give students some hands-on experience with building agents. Students must pass all 3 lab assignments. All labs are due December 12th, 2024 at 11:59pm PST.
